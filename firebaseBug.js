In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating correctly in the Realtime Database.  Specifically, when using the `update()` method with multiple child updates, only some of the updates would persist, while others would revert to their previous values.  The code appeared correct, and other similar update calls were functioning as expected.  No error messages were thrown in the console.
