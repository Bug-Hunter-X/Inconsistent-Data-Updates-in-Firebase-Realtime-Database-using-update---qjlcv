The issue was resolved by replacing the single `update()` call with individual `set()` calls for each child node. This ensures that each update is processed separately, preventing potential conflicts or race conditions that might lead to data reverting to its previous state.  Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
// Original code with the bug
firebase.database().ref('/data').update({
  'value1': newValue1,
  'value2': newValue2
});

// Corrected code
firebase.database().ref('/data/value1').set(newValue1);
firebase.database().ref('/data/value2').set(newValue2);
```
This approach guarantees each child is updated independently, eliminating the inconsistency.
